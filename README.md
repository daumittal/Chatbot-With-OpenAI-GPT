GPT-3, the third iteration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer series, is a state-of-the-art neural network model designed to generate human-like text. Trained on nearly 570 GB of text data, it boasts 175 billion parameters and requires approximately 800 GB of storage. The quality of text generated by GPT-3 is so advanced that it is often indistinguishable from human writing.

**Project Description**

This project involves creating a chatbot using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The chatbot will be powered by GPT-3 through API integration, enabling it to generate intelligent and context-aware responses to user queries. Additionally, the system will maintain a comprehensive log of all user queries and corresponding API responses for reference and analysis.
